E-Waste Monitoring System
Description
The E-Waste Monitoring System is a C++ application designed to help users manage and monitor their electronic devices. Users can sign up, log in, and add details about their devices, including the device name, ID, year of purchase, and condition. The system allows users to monitor their registered devices, recycle devices that are no longer in use, and manage their device inventory effectively.

This system is particularly useful for individuals who want to keep track of their electronic devices and ensure proper recycling of e-waste, contributing to a more sustainable environment.

Problem Statement
Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing environmental concern, with millions of tons of discarded devices piling up in landfills each year. Many users often forget about the electronic devices they own, leading to improper disposal and unnecessary accumulation of e-waste. There is a need for a system that allows users to monitor and manage their devices, ensuring they are recycled responsibly when no longer needed.

Solution
The E-Waste Monitoring System addresses this problem by providing a simple yet effective way for users to track their electronic devices. With features like user registration, device management, and recycling, the system encourages responsible e-waste disposal. The application allows users to:

Sign Up and Log In: Create an account and log in to manage their devices.
Add Device: Register devices by entering details like name, ID, year of purchase, and condition.
Monitor Devices: View a list of all registered devices along with their details.
Recycle Device: Remove devices from the system when they are no longer in use, simulating the recycling process.
By maintaining a record of their devices, users can make informed decisions about recycling and ensure that they contribute to reducing e-waste.
